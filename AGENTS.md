## Bakobo engineering standards

How every Bakobo repo builds is governed by cross-cutting standards, canonical in the sibling
[`bakobo/dev`](../dev) repo. If `../dev` is not checked out beside this one, clone it before design
work: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bakobo/dev`. Always on:

- **Intent-first** development and **strict TDD at 100% branch coverage of new code** — see the
  sections below and [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md).
- **Fail closed.** Untrusted input never carries authority; when something can't be checked, the
  effect does not land ([`org` principle 8](../org/design/purpose-and-principles.md)).
- **High-quality errors.** Every error carries a stable symbolic code, says whether retrying could
  help (permanent vs. transient), and reads as complete, plain sentences in the house voice — never
  "something went wrong." Full standard: [`dev/standards/error-handling.md`](../dev/standards/error-handling.md).
- **Error codes are named, not invented.** A code is `<sorter>.<descriptor>[.<sub>].<disposition>` —
  `e.state.conflict.r`, `w.feature.deprecated.f` — classified by what the *obstacle* was rather than
  by which component raised it, with retryability in the trailing token so a caller can prefix-match
  a whole branch of meaning. Codes are globally unique across Bakobo and declared as module-scope
  literals. Full standard: [`dev/standards/error-codes.md`](../dev/standards/error-codes.md); the
  HTTP wire format is [`dev/standards/http-errors.md`](../dev/standards/http-errors.md).
- **Repo layout.** Architecture and developer docs live in `docs/`; the root holds only repo-level
  files (`README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`), the instruction/config files, build manifests, and
  `this.i` at the root as the source of truth. Don't leave `design.md` loose at the root. Full
  standard, including the content-repo nuance: [`dev/standards/repo-layout.md`](../dev/standards/repo-layout.md).
- **Terminology.** Bakobo's architecture has a precise vocabulary (`core`, `steward`, `mint`, …). Its
  single source of truth is [`bakobo/glossary`](https://github.com/bakobo/glossary), reached via the
  `glossary` MCP server. Consult a term before using it, reconcile prose to the glossary (not the
  reverse), mint/amend terms in-band through the MCP (never hand-edit), and don't let a general word
  masquerade as a formal term. Full standard: [`dev/standards/terminology.md`](../dev/standards/terminology.md).
- **Reviews are permanent.** `reviews/` is tracked, never gitignored, one directory per run named
  `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<milestone>`, and never deleted or pruned on triage — it is the evidence behind what
  `this.i` decided, not a worklist. Open findings become **ticks**; a synthesis carries a `status:`
  header line naming what is still open. Full standard:
  [`dev/standards/reviews.md`](../dev/standards/reviews.md).
- **Tasks and tech debt in `tick`** — see the tick stanza below, not an external tracker.
- **Craftsman working posture.** Development follows the `cc` craftsman methodology — interview at
  intent level, dispatch briefs to worker sub-agents, verify against oracles, and learn from every
  failure. It is Daniel Hardman's personal craft (the private `cc` repo), adopted across Bakobo; the
  operational rules for *this* repo are in [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md).

## Intent methodology

Bakobo develops intent-first. If this repo has design decisions worth explaining, its source of
truth is `this.i` (the intent tree) at the repository root — code and `docs/` are derived from it.
Record each consequential decision in `this.i` **first**, in its own commit, **before** the code
commit it justifies. The full rules — what `this.i` is, when a repo needs one, the speculative
interview, the `why` rebuttal-surface standard, the gate ceremony, and adversarial review — are in
[`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md), in the sibling `bakobo/dev` repo. Read it before
making design decisions here.

If this repo has no `this.i` yet and warrants one, see [`dev/methodology.md`](../dev/methodology.md)
§2 and the shipped `this.i.seed`. A trivial repo (pure content/assets/config, where no one will
later need to know *why*) may skip intent entirely — just delete `this.i.seed`.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install / sync | `uv sync` |
| Test (gates at 100% branch coverage) | `uv run pytest` |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` |
| Types | `uv run mypy` |
| Run the demo | `uv run utina --help` |
| Run the demo on real KERI | `uv run utina demo --substrate keripy --no-pause` |

Python 3.14+, uv, pytest. No plane above the substrate imports a KERI library — not
`utina.fold`, `utina.enact`, `utina.acme` or `utina.cli` — and `tests/test_purity.py`
enforces it by AST inspection, so a lazy import inside a function body will not sneak past
it. `src/utina/substrate/keri*.py` is the one exempt place, and the facade stays the
default so that `--substrate facade` loads no KERI library at all.

## Testing

Strict TDD. Write failing tests that capture the happy path and the edge/unhappy cases for each
requirement, observe them fail, then implement until they pass. Never check in without proving
the suite green. 100% branch coverage of new code is enforced in CI; any gap needs an approved
`deviation:` node in `this.i`. Always leave existing code better tested than you found it.

`tests/test_acceptance_oracle.py` is the outer oracle and mirrors `docs/demo-script.md` row for
row. It skips, naming what the fold still owes, until the API it names exists. Do not weaken a
case in it to make it collect sooner — that is the one change that would make the suite lie.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint and the coverage-gated suite on every push and PR, on
node24 runtimes. When adding or editing a workflow, verify each action's current release and
runtime rather than reaching for a remembered version.

## Task tracking: `tick`

This repo tracks tasks, tech debt, and ideas in a local [`tick`](https://github.com/dhh1128/tick)
ledger (an orphan `tick` branch; the `tick` CLI is the interface). Reads are plain
files — do **not** use an external API for task tracking.

- **First, if a `tick` command says the repo isn't initialized**, run `tick init`
  once to connect this clone to the ledger — it adopts the existing remote ledger
  if a colleague already set one up, or creates a new one otherwise.
- **A tick mark is the sigil `~` immediately followed by a digit-first 4-char
  base32 id** (the id part looks like `4mz3`, so the full mark is that id with a
  leading `~`). It pins a tick to a code location.
- **Before editing a file**, grep it for marks and read what they reference:
  `rg '~[2-7][a-z2-7]{3}\b' <file>` then `tick show <id>`. A mark means recorded
  context exists for that spot — read it first.
- **Search** existing ticks with `tick grep <text>`; **list** with `tick ls`.
- **Capture** new work with `tick add "<title>"` and place the printed mark
  (`~` + the new id) at the relevant code spot.
- When your change **resolves** a tick, run `tick off <id>` and **delete the
  mark(s)** it reports still in the code.
