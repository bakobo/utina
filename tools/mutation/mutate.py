"""Mutation-test the source modules the default branch changed recently, and report survivors.

Part of a two-week mutation-testing pilot that began 2026-10-05. Branch coverage says a line ran
under some test; a surviving mutant says no test would notice that line being wrong. The pilot
measures how many survivors there are and whether they point at real gaps in the tests.

    uv run python tools/mutation/mutate.py [--since "7 days ago"] [--ref HEAD]
        [--module src/<pkg>/x.py ...] [--budget-minutes 300] [--out mutation-out]

Which modules: every ``.py`` file under ``[tool.mutmut].source_paths`` that a first-parent
commit on ``--ref`` touched since ``--since``, minus anything ``[tool.mutmut].do_not_mutate``
excludes. ``--module`` names the files explicitly instead, for a local run. ``mutmut`` itself
reads the rest of its configuration (the pytest arguments) from ``pyproject.toml``.

Writes ``<out>/mutation-report.json`` (one record per surviving mutant) and
``<out>/summary.md``. Exits 0 whether or not any mutant survived, including when nothing
changed or the time budget ran out; exits 2 only when the run itself could not be carried out —
mutmut crashed, or the unmutated suite failed — because a harness failure that reported success
would look exactly like a clean night.

Each record's ``class`` is ``string-only`` when the mutation changes nothing but the text inside
string literals that are message text, which during the pilot is counted rather than ticked,
and ``behavioural`` otherwise. A literal is message text only when ``message_sink`` traces it,
in the source, into an exception constructor in a ``raise``, a ``print``, a logging call,
``warnings.warn``, or a sink the repo declares as ``[tool.mutation] message_sinks`` in
pyproject.toml (``Name`` or ``Name.kwarg``, see ``shared.message_sinks``); the record carries
that sink as ``message_sink``, null when there is none. A malformed declaration fails the run
with ``SINKS_MALFORMED`` before mutmut starts.
``classify`` decides from the diff and that sink, and leans behavioural whenever it cannot vouch
for the change.

A record's ``id`` is a digest of the file, the function and the mutated text, with no line
number or mutmut ordinal in it, so the same surviving mutation keeps its id across nights while
the code around it moves. Two identical mutations in one function are told apart by which
occurrence of the mutated line they sit on, counted in the source, so an id never depends on
which of them happened to survive. ``tools/mutation/ticks.py`` dedupes on it.

A failed run carries one of the two codes below, ``failure_code``, whether retrying can help
(``failure_retryable``), and the code's ``failure_hint``, in the report and its summary.
