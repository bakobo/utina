"""File one ``tick`` per surviving mutant in the latest nightly mutation report.

RUN BY HAND during the mutation-testing pilot (two weeks from 2026-10-05); nothing schedules it.
Survivors are triaged by a person before they become anyone's work, and whether they deserve a
tick at all is one of the things the pilot is measuring.

    uv run python tools/mutation/ticks.py               # latest scheduled run on main
    uv run python tools/mutation/ticks.py --run-id N    # a particular run
    uv run python tools/mutation/ticks.py --report F    # a report already on disk
    ... --dry-run                                       # say what would be filed, file nothing

Each survivor becomes ``tick add --kind debt --tag mutation-survivor "<title>"`` followed by
``tick note <id> <detail>``. The title carries the survivor's stable id as ``[m:<id>]``, and the
note opens with ``mutant-id: <id>``. A survivor whose id already appears in a
``mutation-survivor`` tick, open or closed, is not filed again, so a survivor someone dismissed
stays dismissed; but if that tick's body lacks the note's ``mutant-id`` line, the note never
landed (``tick note`` failed after ``tick add`` succeeded), and it is added now.

A survivor whose mutation only changes the text of a message literal is counted in the closing
summary and not ticked. That is decided by ``mutate.classify`` from the record's own diff and
its ``message_sink``, never from the stored ``class``, and it files whenever it cannot tell: a
record without a sink is behavioural. A sink the repo declares (``[tool.mutation]
message_sinks``, read from ``--root``'s pyproject.toml) counts only while the repo still
declares it: the record's ``declared <entry>`` must name an entry there, so the report and the
repo agree, and a malformed declaration is refused with ``SINKS_MALFORMED`` before the ledger
is touched.

A report is read at most 16 MiB (``shared.MAX_REPORT_BYTES``) and refused unread beyond that.
One that cannot be read, is not UTF-8 JSON, carries any schema but ``shared.SCHEMA``, or is not
the shape ``mutate.py`` writes is refused whole with ``MALFORMED``, naming the record it tripped
on, before the ledger is touched. Every refusal below is printed as ``<code>: <detail>`` with
the code's hint. No tick mark is placed in the code, since a survivor is a question about the
tests and the line it names moves.

Without ``--run-id`` the report comes from the latest successful SCHEDULED run on main, so a
manual run of a feature branch never becomes "the latest"; name such a run explicitly.
